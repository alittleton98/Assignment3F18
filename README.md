# Purpose
- The purpose of GitPic is to allow fellow Reddit users to download pictures to their computer easily from a webpage. The program will also allow the user to pick the save location of the picture on his/her computer. This can be achieved either through entering the link to the desired post to attain the picture, or commenting on that post, selecting your save location in the UI. After this, the program will use web scraping to find the picture on the web page and save it to your device and project the image enlarged onto the users screen.
